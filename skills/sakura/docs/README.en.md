# Sakura Desktop Pet

A desktop companion Agent — chats, changes expressions, speaks, remembers what you allow, and helps with tasks after confirmation.

> The current development version is `0.9.9-dev`. The latest stable Windows package is still `0.9.8`.

## Quick Start

> **On macOS?** See [MACOS_SETUP.md](MACOS_SETUP.md) before you begin.

1. Download `sakura-v0.9.8-windows-x64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Rvosy/sakura/releases).
2. Extract it to a path containing only ASCII characters.
3. Run `install.bat`, then `start.bat`.
4. Enter your OpenAI-compatible API details in the first-run setup.

For source installs, macOS/Linux instructions, TTS, and upgrades, see the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md).

## Features

- **Character-pack driven.** Personality card, portraits, voice references, and GPT-SoVITS weights are all bundled per character.
- **Proactive.** Sakura observes context on a timer and speaks up on her own — you don't have to always start the conversation.
- **Bilingual replies.** Model outputs Japanese dialogue + Chinese subtitle + mood tag; UI drives subtitles, expressions, and voice in sync.
- **Fast local reactions.** Sakura can respond with a short in-character line while the full model reply is still being generated.
- **Screen observation.** On-demand screenshots and autonomous visual summaries fed into the conversation context.
- **Selected screenshots.** Capture a specific screen region from the input bar and attach it to the next message.
- **Multiple model providers.** Save several API providers and choose separate models for chat, vision, and memory curation.
- **Tool use.** Browser control, desktop actions, file read, web search, reminders, notes, and memory.
- **Permission gate.** High-risk tool calls ask for user confirmation before executing.
- **Long-term memory.** Layered memories, relevant recall, automatic curation, and manual editing.
- **Plugins & MCP.** Local plugins, MCP servers, and a built-in web-search MCP server.
- **Character Studio.** Create, edit, validate, and export `.char` packages from a graphical editor.
- **Mobile web chat.** An optional plugin lets a phone share the desktop app's current character, history, and memory without exposing host tools.
- **Windows updater.** `update.bat` verifies update archives and preserves user data while replacing program files.
